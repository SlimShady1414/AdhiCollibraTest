CSN

- CSN should contain only entities which are defined in the service. All other entities comming from imports should be removed.
- We need to have an annotation which defines a transformer to use. If such annotation is present the query attribute should be removed from CSN

DPD file

- The input ports should only include the share, not the single tables
- "sap.sf.workforce:afc:share:person_biographicalDetail:v2.0" - the shares must use the packages defined by the annotatio in CDS file

Transformer file

- It should use transformer which is defined by the annotation
